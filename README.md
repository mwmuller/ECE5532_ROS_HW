# ECE5332
Contains ROS work and devcontainer

1) Setup for WSL-local env
https://github.com/mwmuller/wsl-local-env

2) Once wsl is up and running, run the devcontainer with ```ctrl + shift + p``` -> ```Dev Containers: Revuild container without cache``` or ```Dev Containers: Ropen in container```

3) Once the container finishes opening run: ```./scripts/software_setup_ece5532.bash``` (This will take some time)

### Note
There may be some missing dpeendencies or warnings while installing. **For now** they can be ignored, but they may prove <br>
to be important later.
